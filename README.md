# UnityOctTree
A demonstration of basic oct trees in C# for unity. This was originally made to demonstrate how the datastucure worked.

## What is in the repo
Basic elements: 

- One oct tree is designed to take a array of data representing a int and was designed to test elements of a oct tree in a easy to descibe mannner. 
- The other oct tree holds a array of color data and allows for storage of color.

The unity project currently runs the Integer Oct tree and saves its output as a string. 

Both of these trees lack functionality for various tasks still and but it is to be added. 


## Work In Progress
This repositiory is a work in progress more trees will be added to it gradually.
